# Personal Node Practice Project

## Overview

This project serves as my personal playground for honing my skills in Node.js and Node debugging. Through research and experimentation, I've delved into various file system methods, testing them out within this repository using text files. After experimenting on those text files, I created a basic server capable of dynamically routing users to different HTML pagess based on the HTTP address.
